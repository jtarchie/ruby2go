# Benchmarks

Wall-clock times for the workloads in [`benchmarks/`](benchmarks/), measured
on one Apple-silicon machine (MRI 4.0.7, Crystal 1.22.1, Go 1.27.3, spinel
`baea3e28`) on 2026-10-26, after decision 388. Each cell is the median of 9 runs.
To reproduce:

```sh
RUNS=9 MARKDOWN=1 scripts/benchmark          # this table; SPINEL=/path/to/spinel adds that column
COLS=ruby,rugaroo scripts/benchmark fib array  # some columns, some workloads
```

This run follows decisions 381-402 (the spinel parity work: per-file `int_overflow`, `String#<<` on an
unaliased local, ivar and tuple-stack typing, window reuse for `each_cons`/`each_slice`, counted loops as Go `for`
loops, an open-addressed Hash index): rugaroo's total went from 1.60s to 1.53s, blocks 0.045s to 0.038s, Hash
counting 0.017s to 0.013s; the other rows are within noise. Their bigger effect is on spinel's own suite, below.
`TestCompileCost` compiles 2,032 / 7,948 / 30,419 functions for 05_word_count / 64_observable / 116_cuba_web (2,014 /
7,730 / 30,289 before; the Hash index's probe and insert helpers now compile once per key type).

## What the columns are

- **rugaroo** and **spinel** ([matz/spinel](https://github.com/matz/spinel), a
  Ruby-to-C compiler) compile the same unmodified `.rb` file. A "-" means it
  did not compile it or printed something other than MRI: spinel cannot load
  the gems or one `objects.rb` construct.
- **Crystal** and **Go** are hand-written ports in
  [`benchmarks/crystal`](benchmarks/crystal) and [`benchmarks/go`](benchmarks/go):
  the same algorithm and sizes, written as a programmer in that language would,
  stdlib only, printing exactly what MRI prints. The deviations are noted at the
  top of each file: for example, Go uses error values instead of exceptions and a
  value struct for `objects`' vectors. kramdown and liquid have no port, since a
  port would be a different markdown or template library.
- Each "vs MRI" compares a column only on the rows it ran. That is why spinel's
  ratio is low: its `collections` row (2x slower than MRI) weighs on a smaller
  total.

## Reading the numbers

Where rugaroo trails the native columns, the cost is mostly in its Ruby
semantics: a frozen check on every mutation, a Hash
that keeps insertion order, and objects that are always heap pointers (decisions 359, 360 and 378 removed the box around a nilable object, which put splay ahead
of spinel and Crystal and halved pairing_heap). It is ahead of spinel on
regexp, collections, blocks, format and JSON, where spinel's runtime library is
thinner. Against Crystal it wins on exceptions, which Crystal unwinds with a
backtrace per raise.

The closest rows to MRI are JSON and kramdown. MRI's `json` is a C extension; rugaroo's
generator writes into one buffer instead of a String per nested value
(decision 346), and its parser builds Hashes on an entry array (decision 350). kramdown spends its regex time partly on
patterns RE2 cannot match (lookbehinds, atomic groups, backreferences), which
run on the regexp2 backtracker (decisions 242, 332, 347).

`Math` calls Go's `math` package directly, so a printed transcendental can
differ from MRI in the last digit — Go and MRI's libm are both within one
ulp and neither is uniquely correct ([decision 43](docs/decisions/043.md)).
Ahead-of-time compilation is the other trade: `rugaroo build` is ~0.3s warm
on hello-world, but the resulting binary starts in under 10ms (MRI ~60ms).

## Integer overflow modes

`benchmarks/bignum.rb` carries `# int_overflow: promote`, so rugaroo compiles it
with Bignums ([decision 372](docs/decisions/372.md)) and `scripts/benchmark`
hands spinel the same `--int-overflow=promote`. A Bignum is a Go `math/big`
value only past 64 bits; smaller values stay machine words. That puts rugaroo
ahead of MRI's bignum code (3.6x) and spinel (2x), and between the Crystal
(GMP) and Go (`math/big`) ports.

What the default `raise` mode's overflow checks cost, measured as rugaroo built
with `--int-overflow=wrap` (no checks on `+`, `-`, `*`, `-@`) against the
default, median of 9 paired runs per workload:

| workload | raise | wrap | wrap vs raise |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| array | 0.020s | 0.023s | +14.0% |
| binary_trees | 0.008s | 0.008s | -2.7% |
| blocks | 0.065s | 0.062s | -3.6% |
| collections | 0.125s | 0.125s | +0.3% |
| exceptions | 0.117s | 0.115s | -1.4% |
| fib | 0.016s | 0.016s | +3.7% |
| format | 0.237s | 0.238s | +0.2% |
| hash | 0.014s | 0.015s | +0.3% |
| json | 0.114s | 0.114s | +0.1% |
| kramdown | 0.405s | 0.401s | -1.0% |
| liquid | 0.164s | 0.164s | +0.0% |
| math | 0.008s | 0.008s | -0.7% |
| objects | 0.035s | 0.035s | +1.0% |
| pairing_heap | 0.205s | 0.203s | -0.8% |
| regexp | 0.212s | 0.211s | -0.2% |
| splay | 0.013s | 0.012s | -2.3% |
| strings | 0.029s | 0.029s | +2.1% |

No workload gets faster without the checks beyond run-to-run noise (the
`array` row is a 20 ms run). The checked operators inline into one compare and
a branch the CPU predicts, so `raise` stays the default at no measurable cost
and `wrap` is for programs whose arithmetic is meant to wrap (hashes,
checksums, random number generators), not for speed.

## spinel's benchmark suite

spinel ships its own benchmarks: 73 programs in
[`benchmark/`](https://github.com/matz/spinel/tree/master/benchmark), mostly
micro-benchmarks of one VM path (ivar reads and writes, sends, allocation,
loops) plus a few small applications (a template engine, a CSV pipeline, a
Lisp). Neither compiler was tuned against the other's suite, so this is the
away game for rugaroo, as `benchmarks/` is for spinel. Same machine and
versions as above, spinel `baea3e28`, 2026-10-27 after decision 402, median of 5 runs:

```sh
S=/path/to/spinel
NIL_CHECK=runtime:bm_fasta,bm_histogram,... INT_OVERFLOW=promote:bm_bigint_fib,bm_pidigits \
  RUNS=5 MARKDOWN=1 BENCH_DIR=$S/benchmark SPINEL=$S/spinel COLS=ruby,yjit,rugaroo,spinel scripts/benchmark
```

`bm_bigint_fib` and `bm_pidigits` build with `--int-overflow=promote` in both
compilers: spinel promotes their growing locals in its default mode too, and
the files carry no `# int_overflow:` line (decision 381). Rows marked † build
rugaroo with `--nil-check=runtime` (decision 393, below); spinel needs no flag.
Every other row is rugaroo's default.

rugaroo builds 65 of the 73 unmodified: 47 by default, 18 more with
`--nil-check=runtime`. On the 65 rows both ran,
the totals are MRI 98.7s, YJIT 77.3s, rugaroo 5.48s (18.0x MRI), spinel 4.15s
(23.8x MRI); before decisions 381-388 that was 9.5x against 23.3x on 44 rows.
The footer's ratios above are over different row sets, so spinel's there
includes the 8 programs rugaroo does not build.

- **rugaroo ahead of spinel:** `bm_send_cfunc_block` (5.5x), `bm_rbs_items*`
  (1.9-2.6x), `bm_tree_walker` † (2.1x), `bm_handle_readonly_param` †,
  `bm_ruby_xor` †, `bm_splay` (1.35x), `bm_gcbench`, `bm_rbtree`,
  `bm_linked_list`, `bm_ao_render` (1.1-1.25x): the allocation and block-call
  rows, as in the main table. `bm_loops_times`, `bm_ackermann`, `bm_fib` and
  `bm_attr_accessor` are even.
- **Closed by decision 387** (counted loops as Go `for` loops, in-place
  `Array#[]=`, unboxed compares): `bm_loops_times` 0.19s to 0.040s,
  `bm_range_each` 2.15s to 0.67s, `bm_sieve` 0.099s to 0.035s,
  `bm_structaset` 0.064s to 0.047s, `bm_life` 0.16s to 0.088s.
- **Closed by decision 391** (a `shift`/`pop` an `empty?` check guards is
  its element, one-element `push`/`<<` appends at the site):
  `bm_so_lists` 0.20s to 0.084s (4,323M to 684M instructions; spinel 282M).
- **Closed by #134** (`Float#**`): `bm_partial_sums` 0.43s to 0.074s.
- **Closed by decisions 398-399** (a module's singleton class as a leaf;
  ASCII fast paths for `String#length`/`[]`, unboxed `String? == String`):
  `bm_getivar_module` 0.15s to 0.070s, `bm_template` † 0.73s to 0.19s,
  `bm_json_parse` † 0.25s to 0.065s, `bm_huffman` † 0.028s to 0.019s; #139
  has the rest of the String gap.
- **Closed by decisions 400-401** (an Integer overflow panics a value, so
  small arithmetic methods inline; a Struct writer's frozen check folds away
  when nothing calls `freeze`; `/dev/null` is not a terminal, so `print` stays
  buffered, as in MRI; `Math.sqrt` called directly; Float operators written at
  the call site): `bm_so_mandelbrot` 0.12s to 0.044s, `bm_structaset` 0.046s
  to 0.018s, `bm_reader_index` † 0.51s to 0.35s, `bm_ao_render` 0.13s to
  0.099s, `bm_keyword_args` 168M to 42M instructions. `bm_nil_recv_loop` went
  0.069s to 0.085s with the same instruction count: Go now loads `v` and `nxt`
  with one pair load, which lengthens its pointer-chasing chain on Apple cores.
- **Closed by decision 402** (`Array#count`/`#sum` and `Array.new(n) { }`
  blocks as Go loops at the call, #140) and the `Integer#*` part of 400:
  `bm_life` 0.081s to 0.050s (1,082M to 615M instructions; spinel 478M),
  `bm_matmul` † 249M to 205M instructions.
- **Furthest behind:** `bm_getivar_module` (10x; Go does not hoist the ivar
  load out of the loop, as clang does for spinel; decision 398),
  `bm_nested_loop` (3.2x: spinel's C compiler folds the loops away),
  `bm_point_in_polygon` (3x: its Float arrays fall back to untyped, #141),
  `bm_inline`, `bm_so_lists`, `bm_getivar`,
  `bm_partial_sums` (2.6-2.8x: Go's pure-Go `math.Sin`/`Cos` on arm64).
- Rows under 10 ms are mostly process start-up for both binaries.

Why 26 do not compile by default, by the first error each reports (18 of them build with `--nil-check=runtime`):

| cause | programs | |
|---|---:|---|

spinel compiles and runs all 73. The nil row is the design choice that costs
rugaroo the most programs here: by default it makes a program prove `a[i]` is
not `nil` before using it as the element type. `--nil-check=runtime` (decision
393) puts a run-time check in its place, as spinel and MRI do, and is the
program's choice; `NIL_CHECK=runtime[:name,...]` passes it to rugaroo only. With
it, all 18 compile and print what MRI prints (the † rows; three of them also
need `setbyte` on a String only they hold, decision 395, and `bm_fannkuch` and
`bm_stark_field` needed decision 396's by-value `Integer?`, #133).
